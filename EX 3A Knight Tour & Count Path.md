# EX 3A Knight Tour & Count Path
## DATE:17-07-2025
## AIM:
To write a python program to find minimum steps to reach to specific cell in minimum moves by knight


## Algorithm

1. Initialize an empty chessboard of size `(d1, d2)` with all cells set to 0.
2. Start the knight's tour at position `(x, y)` and mark it with move number 1.
3. Repeat for each remaining move (total `d1*d2 - 1` moves):
4. Find all valid knight moves from the current position to unvisited cells.
5. From those, choose the one with the fewest onward moves (Warnsdorff’s Rule).
6. Mark the selected position with the current move number.
7. End when no more valid moves are found or the board is fully visited.
8. Print the final board (unless GUI mode is enabled).

## Result:
The program executed successfully, and the minimum number of steps for the knight to reach the target was calculated.
